Well when i started playing, something that bugged me was the bad quality of recolours, the missing black outlines or quality change between animations. So when I started playing again I decided to fix the graphics as I played.

Mostly the things I fixed where trees, grass mario/luigi sprites, the goomba sprite/monster color mismatch and battle scenes.

Make a backup of the graphic if you don't like my revamps and want to change back to the original graphics.
