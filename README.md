### Message to Nintendo

Nintendo, if you see this, it would be appreciated if you can allow this fangame to live on. We could work together to turn the fangame into a canon work of art and remaster everything either to the Mario and Luigi 3DS game graphics and assets, in 3D graphics and assets like the new Super Mario RPG Remake, or however you want it.

### How to download

Simply follow the same download procedure for all GitHub source code downloads, assuming that you know how to navigate and use GitHub.
If you would like to contribute to further development or modification of the fangame (includes porting this fangame to a newer RPG Maker Studio like MV for example), feel free to do so, but read the section below.

### Repository and Source

You are only allowed to use the source as outlined by ICU Gigasoft on their social media platform accounts under the same name (ICU Gigasoft) and by partner or affiliated partner divisions (I-Division, C-Division, U-Division).
This repository was created to store the game and source data of SMRPGSS and SMRPGSS-EE, since it was missing from the ICU Gigasoft official website and forums.

## Legal

SMRPGSS is not affiliated with or endorsed by Nintendo in any way, shape, or form, unless explicitly stated by Nintendo itself.
SMRPGSS is a non-profit fangame and therefore does not make any money.
