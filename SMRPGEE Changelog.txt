Complete Breakdown:

v1.2.4:
-Fixed starting graphical glitch where Mario would show up in the top left corner of the intro screen
-Added a progress checklist so you can check what unlockables you have yet to find

v1.2.3:
-Game-Breaking Dark Star Bug (supposedly) fixed
-New game spawn point fixed
-Ameoba "cheat" block removed. It was accidentally left there from the developer testing phase.

v1.2.2:
-Try your luck at fighting the new form of culex! You'll have to beat hard mode boss rush first, and then you can fight him by talking to the black Luigi (not yet tested; possibly very buggy)
-Cure nerfed: -2 turn duration from original 8 turn duration, HP recovery reduced from 12% of your max HP per turn to 6%, FP recovery reduced from 10% of your max FP to 4%. FP cost reduced by 10% its previous amount
-Cleanse buffed to now only cost 8% Luigi's max FP, down from 13%
-All bosses buffed slightly
-Debilitate nerfed greatly, losing 60% of its original effect. Flame wall buffed the caster's defense with an effect rating of 3 and a special scaling of 4, but debilitate previously lowered all stats by an effect rating of a whopping 10 and has special scaling of 5. Now its effect rating is 4. FP cost reduced from 28 to 25 to compensate slightly.
-Curse FP drain increased by 30%, up from 10% to 13% of the target's max FP
-MP typo on Luigi's Starlight fixed to now say FP
-Starlight's effect rating buffed 20%, from 5 to 6.
-Regen was glitched and would last infinitely or just not get inflicted on your time. Now fixed to last 5 turns, restoring 15% max FP + 3 set extra FP per turn for the entire party.
-Burn status effect duratin glitch fixed to last infinitely, but has a 15% chance of recovery each turn. Damage dealt is 5% max HP + 5 more set HP.
-Refresh turn duration buffed from 5 turns to 99 turns, but you still have a 100% chance of losing it once taking damage
-Frozen status effect FP drain increased 60%, from 5% max FP to 8% max FP.
-Ice Mario and Ice Luigi's frost wall nerfed to 3 effect rating from 4; spamming this move with both Ice Mario and Ice Luigi could lead to a super-buffed tanky Luigi that had ridiculously powerful spells
-Aqua Arrow's effect rating buffed from 22 to 25; this skill was very helpful in utilizing Croak Mario's high-FP cost skills, but was simply not recovering enough for good usage of the class
-Frog Mire greatly nerfed from 13 down to 5 effect rating; spamming this skill with its low FP cost and Croak's passive regeneration enabled you to slow down single bosses like the nega orb to the point where you could move a ridiculous amount of times before the boss could even attack. Stack this with aqua arrow to drain FP and bosses could barely use skills when they did get the chance to attack.
-Bubble Burst modified to no longer drain the massive amounts of FP it once did. It's effect rating has been increased from 115 to a whopping 173, and now has a chance to inflict curse, but in exchange lost the ensured FP drain and gains +35 more FP cost, from 68 to 103. This is because Croak was advertised as a hard-hitter, but really lacked power skills.
-Ghost Flame may also curse now, and has increased effect rating from 58 to 87, and now has a chance to curse along with the burn chance. In exchange, its FP cost also increased from 18 to 24. This was because the P. 5000 suit is attained very late in the game and thus Ghost Flame's previously weak power did not suit it. 
-All previous equipment has lost the ability to halve FP costs. This effect on certain equipment was entirely game-breaking and made the game a cinch. In exchange, these certain pieces of equipment gained increased stats.
-Yellow coin, Crimson coin, and Tadpole coin all gained buffs to the special they give. They now give 20, 42, and 65 respectively.
-Isolated Isle monsters all buffed; once getting the new equipment from the store, particularly caster equips for Luigi, you could take out groups of monsters ridiculously easily and quickly. EXP rewards boosted slightly to compensate.
-Culex and Blue Nega Orb severely buffed by increasing almost all stats by a moderately small amount, while Culex's crystals all gain +200 HP. These bosses were highlights of being tough, but the new equipment from the MK Armory made them much easier to handle.
-Animation glitch fixed on Mario's basic fireball
-Flame Punch's effect rating increased from 51 to 63
-Neutralize's FP cost reduced from 15% Mario's max FP down to 12%
-Bubble shield's FP cost increased from 11 to 14
-Frog Hygiene's Attack and Special influence decreased from 10 to 8; FP cost increased from 73 to 87
-Flame wall's FP cost reduced from 22 to 19
-Mario's Super Jump Punch increased effect rating and FP cost; Effect rating increased from 40 to 44, FP cost from 12 to 14
-Flip Kick's effect rating increased from 88 to 94
-Cape Swipe's effect rating increased from 31 to 34
-Mario Finale's FP cost reduced from 45% of Mario's max FP down to 40%
-Luigi Cyclone's FP cost increased by 3, effect rating increased from 48 to 62, Special influence increased from 9 to 10
-Power Poke's FP cost increased from 27 to 31, Special influence increased from 8 to 10
-Green Missile's random +75 damage increased to random +90 damage. Chance of bonus 90 damage increased from 50% to 65%
-Luigi's Super Jump Punch? Increased hit rate from 25% to 35% and increased effect rating from 330 to 375; simply did not hit high enough nor did the 1/2 stat debuff last long enough based off of the high FP cost and low hit rate.
-Negative zone's stat lowering effect rating decreased from 3 to 2. FP cost decreased from 85% of Luigi's max FP down to 70%
-Acid Rain's Attack influence increased from 1 to 2, special influence decreased from 4 to 2, increased variance from 2 to 3, reduced defense lowering effect rating from 5 to 4
-Corrode status effect nerfed: 5% max HP + 35 damage per turn reduced to 4% + 30, 10% max FP + 20 reduced down to 7% + 15
-Death Acid's status effect nerfed from 8% + 300 HP down to 7% + 315 HP. Bosses with more than 1500 HP will be less affected by this skill now
-FP poison FP cost buffed from 15% Mario's Max to a whopping 65%, nerfed to drain 5% per turn for 20 turns rather than 25% per turn for 4 turns; This was necessary because spending only 15% of your max FP to render a caster boss useless was overwhelming
-Refill Acid glitch fixed (hopefully). Nerfed from 40% per turn for 2 turns down to 35% per turn for 2 turns
-Vigorous pin changed from its old state to an item that's only purpose is to be sold; increased selling cost from 2000 to 3500, description changed.
-Gag boots stats reversed to now reduce attack and boost special for Luigi
-Fixed the P. 5000 eradicator skill to not 1-shot kill non-ghost enemies.
-Added new feature: Options shack! Here you can change some system options such as Battle Music, and System GFX sets
-Added 7 new GFX sets! You only start out with the default and 1 new one, so you'll have to search across the world to find those 6 secret ones.

-New Mario Skill: Flame Punch. This skill deals fire damage like fireball, but is based heavily off of attack influence. Learned at level 22 with a slightly higher effect rating than super fireball.
-New Luigi Skill: Regenerate. This skill costs 85% max FP of Luigi and slowly regenerates 4% + 1 FP per turn for all characters until the end of the fight. Learned at level 30.
-New Frog Mario Skill: Bubble Shield. This skill replaces frog hygiene and will boost resistance to all elements of an ally for a low cost. Even influence from attack and intelligence with small variance.
-New Mario Skill: Neutralize. This skill removes all status effects that benefit opponents, including ghosted and stat buffs, as well as pretty much any other similar condition. Learned at level 30, and costs 15% max FP.
-New Mr. L Skill: Green Thunder. This skill has a high effect rating, is based mostly off of intelligence, has high MP cost and variance, and will drain MP with a chance of paralysis. Targets a single enemy and can be learned at level 54.
-New Fire Luigi skill: Flame Wall. This skill moderately increases defense and fire/water resist of all allies.

-New Suit! Ice suit: Can you find out where to get it? I placed it somewhere early in the game in a place that requires you to do a lot but grants pretty much no rewards. Once you've found it, you can equip it by going to the changing room, where you will find a new portal!
-Many monster special attacks now inflict new status conditions such as curse and freeze in exchange for a small amount of effect rating
-Luigi's coin weapons have lost all their physical attack status points, and they have been instead placed into intelligence
-New suit! Croak suit: It's located in the Tower of the Frogs, somewhere early in the game. However, you won't be able to get it that early because you need to buy the key from a late shop, as well as already have the frog suit for the shop to stock the key.
-Croak suit comes with 3 new skills, has frog hygiene instead of the frog suit, also has bubble shield like the frog suit, and permanently applies a status condition which slowly regenerates HP and FP every turn to Mario in battle!
-New suit: Poltergust 5000 suit: In order to get this suit, you'll have to craft it using 3 Ghost Turbines at Jerry's House with Merry. But how do you get the 3 Ghost Turbines? They're somewhere inside the haunted mansions, and they shouldn't be too hard to find! The King Boo guards it personally in order to make sure no one can utilize it's power.
-Poltergust 5000 suit comes with 3 new skills, and has 2-3 more skills from the original Poltergust 3000.
-New Condition: Fright! This condition will halve special and speed of the target for 3 turns.
